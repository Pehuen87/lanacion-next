# Challenge Next La Nacion - Product Listing App

## Overview

This project, "Challenge Next La Nacion," was created by Pehu√©n Assalone. It is a frontend application built with Next.js v13, with App Router, which showcases a list of products obtained from a server. The application also enables users to perform searches and navigate through paginated results using server-side components. The frontend uses Axios for making API requests to fetch user data, and the entire project is styled using Tailwind CSS.
